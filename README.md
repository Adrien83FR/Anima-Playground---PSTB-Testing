# Anima-Playground---PSTB-Testing

Welcome! This project was automatically generated using [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

To get started, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system. It is required to install dependencies and run the project locally.

Once Node.js is installed, open your terminal in the root folder of the project and install all dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

After the installation is complete, you can launch a development version of the app with:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should then be available at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

If everything looks good and you want to generate a production-ready build, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will output the optimized build into the `dist` folder, ready to be deployed.
